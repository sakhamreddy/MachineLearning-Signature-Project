# SEER Breast Cancer Prediction Project
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying breast cancer patients' survival outcomes based on various features such as age, marital status, race, tumor size, survival months, and other medical attributes. The project uses multiple machine learning algorithms to classify whether a patient is alive or deceased. Key features include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building with several classification algorithms.

## About the Project
This project uses the SEER Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains information on over 4,024 patients. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is alive or deceased based on their medical data. Various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests are used, and their performance is evaluated using different metrics.

Key features:
- Data Acquisition and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building and Evaluation (SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forests)
- Ensemble Learning with Bagging and Majority Voting

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following software and dependencies:

- R programming environment
- Required R packages: `corrplot`, `magrittr`, `dplyr`, `ggcorrplot`, `psych`, `RVAideMemoire`, `moments`, `tidyverse`, `CatEncoders`, `DMwR`, `kernlab`, `C50`, `gmodels`, `caret`, `Metrics`, `irr`, `plotly`, `cvms`, `ipred`, `caretEnsemble`, `randomForest`

Install the required R packages using the following command:

```r
# Example for installing dependencies
install.packages(c("corrplot", "magrittr", "dplyr", "ggcorrplot", "psych", "RVAideMemoire", "moments", "tidyverse", "CatEncoders", "DMwR", "kernlab", "C50", "gmodels", "caret", "Metrics", "irr", "plotly", "cvms", "ipred", "caretEnsemble", "randomForest"))
```

### Installation
Step-by-step guide to set up the project locally.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sakhamreddy/.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd repository

# Install dependencies
Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("corrplot", "magrittr", "dplyr", "ggcorrplot", "psych", "RVAideMemoire", "moments", "tidyverse", "CatEncoders", "DMwR", "kernlab", "C50", "gmodels", "caret", "Metrics", "irr", "plotly", "cvms", "ipred", "caretEnsemble", "randomForest"))'
```

## Usage
To run the project, use the provided R scripts. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

```r
# Example usage
source("SEER_Breast_Cancer_Analysis.R")
```
